# simplex-noise.js
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jwagner/simplex-noise.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jwagner/simplex-noise.js)

simplex-noise.js is a fast simplex noise implementation in Javascript. It works in the browser and on nodejs.

## Demos

- Simple 2D plasma on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/jwagner/pen/BNmpdm/?editors=001).
- [3D voxel world generation](http://29a.ch/sandbox/2012/voxelworld/) example.
- Film grain in [analog film emulator](http://29a.ch/film-emulator/).

## Usage

```javascript
// initializing a new simplex instance
// do this only once as it is relatively expensive
var noise = simplex(Math.random),
    value2d = noise(x, y),
    value3d = noise(x, y, z),
    value4d = noise(x, y, z, w);
```

You can also pass an alternative random function to the constructor that is
used to build the permutation table.
This can be used with a custom pseudo random number generator:

```javascript
var random = new Alea(seed),
    noise = simplex(random),
    value = noise(x, y);
```

The ALEA PRNG can be found on in the npm package [alea](https://npmjs.org/package/alea).

## node.js

Node.js is also supported, you can install the package using [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/simplex-noise).

```javascript
var simplex = require('simplex-noise'),
    noise = simplex(Math.random),
    value = noise(x, y);
```

## Benchmarks

- [Comparison between 2D and 3D noise](http://jsperf.com/simplex-noise/4)
- [Comparison with simplex implementation in three.js](http://jsperf.com/simplex-noise-comparison/3)

For development you can open `perf/index.html` and watch the console or run `node perf/benchmark.js` in a shell.
There is also a rake task for comparing your current changes can also run `make compare`.
The command works using git stash.

## Tests

There are some simple unit tests for this library to run them
```shell
npm install && npm test
```

## Changelog

### 2.4.0
- Included a PRNG based on ALEA to directly allow seeding
- Included typescript definitions

### 2.3.0

:warning: **This release changes the output of the noise functions.** :warning:

In the future such changes will be released as a new major version.

- Corrected generation of permutation table
- Moved tests to mocha/chai
- Cleanup

### 2.2.0
- Small performance improvement for 2D noise

### 2.1.1
- Increased entropy by fixing a little initialization issue.

### 2.1.0
- AMD support

### 2.0.0
- Changed node.js api, SimplexNoise is now exported directly.
- Added unit tests

### 1.0.0
- Initial Release


## Requirements

It requires typed arrays. If you want to use it in browsers without support
you will need to use a polyfill like [typedarray.js](http://www.calormen.com/polyfill/typedarray.js).

This is mostly a direct javascript port of the [Java implementation](http://webstaff.itn.liu.se/~stegu/simplexnoise/SimplexNoise.java)
by Stefan Gustavson and Peter Eastman.

The integrated pseudo random generator is based on code by by Johannes Baag√∏e.
